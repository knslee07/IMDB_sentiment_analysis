# IMDB_sentiment_four_methods
## This is a personal repository for the Kaggle's IMDB sentiment analysis.

### These jupyter notebooks do sentiment analysis of IMDB reviews using the four different methods
1. perceptron with count and tfidf vectorizers
2. logistic regression with count and tfidf vectorizers
3. SequenceClassification model using the ELECTRA-small-discriminator checkpoint.

Lastly, I used a quick but powerful fix using Hugging Face.
4. Hugging face pipeline
